Learn how to do an easy multi-select.

Each command should be customizable? Could have its own input box.

Could pop up a new window for each main directory that is selected?

Test:
    Test all
    or
    Test select
    Test run
    and/or
    Text entry box with executable name(s)?

    Should remember previous tests
    Should be able to clear selected tests.

    User won't be able to select individual executables until everything
    has been built.
        Force them to run test all first?
        Allow them to?

    Could have checkboxes to enable/disable tests,
    or a multi-select dropdown.



Directory selection:
    remember current directory
    handle failure


Print output to new window?
  Then learn to open a new window
  Then learn to print to the new window
    IPC? Send output to new window? Execute command in new window?

Capture errors:
  What if programs don't exist?
  Make system doesn't exist?
  etc
  What if we run or test while still compiling? Commands could be executed too quickly.
  Run without compile spits out unhandled js ChildProcess error.

What do we run for tests?
  make test
  ctest
  individual executables

How to test my code?

Pretty print args[] array if we have multiple.
  Right now it prints as "arg1,arg2".
  I'd like it to be "arg1 arg2".

I've been very lazy with the if (project_root) conditional.
  Think about this!

Figure out what to do with the DOM - I've been lazy.
